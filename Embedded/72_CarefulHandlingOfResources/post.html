<p>The careful handling of resources - may it be for example memory, files or sockets - is a key concern of programming in C++. This holds in particular true for the embedded programming that is often characterized by limited resources. Therefore, I will write a few posts about this challenging and versatile topic.</p>
<hr id="system-readmore" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my first attempt to write this post I wanted to directly jump into the memory allocation with operator new. Fortunately, I went a few steps back. Memory management is only one but admittedly an import component of resource management in C++. The story is a lot more versatile. So I want to write about three domains of resource management in C++.</p>
<p>There is the automatic memory management in C++ that is quite easy to use. I addition we have the well known idioms in C++ that are the base of the automatic memory management. At last C++ offers explicit memory management in which the user has the full power to his disposal. I will follow this three steps in my post. Because I don't want to create the impression that explicit memory management is basic knowledge for the C++ developer.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>Automatic memory management</h2>
<p>I start at the basic level with smart pointers.</p>
<h3>Smart pointer</h3>
<p>C++ has four different smart pointers. Each of them has the task to take care of the lifetime of it underlying resource. The <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::unique_ptr</span> takes explicitly ownership of the lifetime of&nbsp;one resource. A <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::shared_ptr</span> shares the ownership of a resource with the other <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::shared_ptr</span>'s. Therefore, cycles can appear and the resource can not automatically be released. It's the job of the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::weak_ptr</span> to break these cycles. The last one is the with C++11 deprecated <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::auto_ptr.</span> Why? You will see in a later post.</p>
<h3>STL container</h3>
<p>STL container <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">cont</span> like<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"> </span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::vector</span> or <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::string</span> automatically manage their memory. E.g.: they have a method<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"> cont.push_back </span>to add a new element to the container.&nbsp;The size of the container will automatically grow. But it works also the other way around. Thanks to <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">cont.shrink_to_fit,</span> the container will be reduced to its&nbsp;size.</p>
<h2>C++ idioms</h2>
<p>Each modern STL implementations uses the C++ idioms move semantic, perfect forwarding, and the RAII idiom very often. To understand the underlying mechanism we have to dig deeper in the details of the automatic memory management. Before I write about the C++ idioms here is a small appetizer.</p>
<h3>Move semantic</h3>
<p>The key idea of move semantic is quite simple: use cheap move operations instead of expensive copy operations for big objects. This holds in particular true for such objects that can not be copied. A typical example is a <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::mutex</span> or&nbsp; a <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::unique_ptr.</span></p>
<h3>Perfect forwarding</h3>
<p>Perfect forwarding uses under the hood similar techniques like the move semantic. The key idea of perfect forwarding is a different one. The job of perfect forwarding is it to take arguments in a function template and forward them identically. Typical use case are constructors that forward their argument to the base class constructor or factory methods which creates new objects.</p>
<h3>RAII idiom</h3>
<p>The idea of the RAII idiom is quite simple. You bind the acquisition and the release of a resource to the lifetime of a local object. Therefore, the resource will automatically be&nbsp;initialized in the constructor and released in the destructor. The acronym RAII stand for <strong>R</strong>esource <strong>A</strong>cquisition <strong>I</strong>s <strong>I</strong>nitialization. Smart pointer and locks implement this technique.</p>
<h2>Explicit memory management</h2>
<p>Now we are in the domain of the experts. Thanks to the explicit memory management in C++ it is possible the tailor memory management to your needs. You can adjust it to simple objects or arrays, but you can also adjust it on a class level or global level. You can write your own memory allocators and use them with the help of <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">placement new. </span></p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>As promised I will&nbsp;write about the various flavours of memory management in C++ from top to bottom. I start with the automatic memory management with smart pointers.</p>
