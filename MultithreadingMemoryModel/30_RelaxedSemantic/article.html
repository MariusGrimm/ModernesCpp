<p>The relaxed semantic is the end of the Scala. The relaxed semantic is the weakest of all memory models and guarantees only, that the operations on atomic variables are atomic.</p>
<hr id="system-readmore" />
<h3>No synchronization and ordering constraints</h3>
<p>That's quite easy. If there are no rules, we can not break them. But that's too easy. The program should have well defined behaviour. That means in this case: No <a href="index.php/threads-sharing-data">race condition</a>. To guarantee this, you typically use synchronization and ordering constraints of stronger memory models to control operations with relaxed semantic. How does this work? A thread can see the effects of another thread in arbitrary order. So, you must only to be sure, that there are points in your program, in which all operations on all threads gets synchronized.</p>
<p>A typical example for an atomic operation, in which the sequence of operations doesn't matter, is a counter. The key of a counter is not, in which order the different threads increment the counter. The key of the counter is, that all increments are atomic and that all threads are done at the end. Have a look at the example.</p>

<p>The three most interesting lines are 13, 24, and 26.</p>
<p>In line 13 the atomic number <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">cnt</span> is incremented with relaxed semantic. So, we have the guarantee, that the operation is atomic. The <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">fetch_add</span> operation established an ordering on <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">cnt.</span> The function <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">f</span> (line 10 - 15) is the work package of the threads. Each thread gets its work package in line 21.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thread creation is one synchronization point. The other synchronization point is the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">t.join() </span>call in line 24.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The creator thread synchronizes with all its child's in line 24. It waits with the&nbsp; <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">t.join()</span> call until all its childs are done. <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">t.join()</span> is the reason, that the results of the atomic operations are published. To say it more formally: t.join() is a release operation.</p>
<p>At the end, there is a <em>happen-before</em> relation between the increment operation in line 13 and the reading of the counter <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">cnt</span> in line 26.</p>
<p>The result is, that the program returns always 10000. Boring? No, calming!</p>
<p><img src="images/blog/Speichermodell/RelaxedSemantik/relaxed.png" alt="relaxed" /></p>
<p>A typical example for an atomic counter, which uses the relaxed semantic, is the reference counter of <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::shared_ptr</span>. That will only hold for the increment operation. Key for incrementing the reference counter is, that the operation is atomic. Not key is, which thread increments in which order. That will not hold for the decrementation of the reference counter. These operations need an acquire-release semantic with the destructor.</p>
<p>I want to explicitly say thanks to Anthony Williams, author of the well known book C++ Concurrency in Action. He gave me very valuable tips for this post. Anthony writes his own blog to concurrency in modern C++: <a href="https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/blog/">https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/blog/.</a></p>
<h2>Business before pleasure</h2>
<p>Business before pleasure. That's my simple motto for the next posts. So, I will use the theory about <a href="index.php/atomics">atomics</a> and the <a href="index.php/c-memory-model">memory model</a> in practice.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The program looks quite simple. But it has undefined behaviour. Why? I will answer the question in a following post. But that is only the first step. I want to optimize the program. If you want to play with atomics and the memory model, it's always a good idea to have a static code analyser at your disposal. So, in the next post, I will introduce the invaluable precious tool <a href="http://svr-pes20-cppmem.cl.cam.ac.uk/cppmem/">CppMem.</a></p>
