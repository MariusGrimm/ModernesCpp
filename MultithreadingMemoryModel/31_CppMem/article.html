<p><a href="http://svr-pes20-cppmem.cl.cam.ac.uk/cppmem/">CppMem</a> is an interactive tool for exploring the behaviour of small code snippets of the C++ memory model. It should, no it has to be in the tool box of each programmer, who deals seriously with the memory model.</p>
<hr id="system-readmore" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The online tool CppMem provides in twofold way very valuable services.</p>
<ol>
	<li>CppMem verifies the well defined behaviour of small code snippets. The tool performs on the base of the C++ memory model all possible interleavings of threads, visuals each one in a graph and annotates these graphs with additional details</li>
	<li>The very accurate analysis of CppMem gives you a deep insight in the C++ memory model. To make it short. CppMem is the tool for a better understanding of the C++ memory model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, it's in the nature of the things, that you have at first to overcome a few hurdles. The nature of the things is, that CppMem give you the whole details to the extremely challenging topic and is highly configurable. So, my plan is to present you the components of the tool, which you can also install on your PC.</p>
<h2>The overview</h2>
<p>My simplified overview uses the default configuration. This overview should give you the base for further experiments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="images/blog/Speichermodell/CppMemUeberblick/CppMemUeberblickNumbers.png" alt="CppMemUeberblickNumbers" width="800" height="523" style="margin: 15px;" /></p>
<p>For simplicity reasons, I will follow the red numbers in the screenshot.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Model</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Specifies the C++ memory model. <em>preferred</em> is the C++ memory model.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Program</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Is the executable program in C or C++ syntax.</li>
			<li>CppMem overs a bunch of programs to typical scenarios of multithreading. To get the details to these programs, read the very well written article <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cpp/popl085ap-sewell.pdf">Mathematizing C++ Concurrency</a>. Of course you can also use your own code.</li>
			<li>CppMem is about multithreading, so there are two specialities.<br />
				<ul>
					<li>You can easily define two thread by the symbols <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">{{{&nbsp; ... ||| ... }}}</span>.&nbsp;The three dots (...) are the work packages of the two threads.</li>
					<li>By using <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">x.readvalue(1)</span>, you reduce the possible interleavings of the threads to this interleavings, for which the thread execution gives the value 1 for x.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Display Relations</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Describes the relations between the read, write and read-write modifications on atomic operations, fences and locks.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>You can explicitly enable the relations in the annotated graph with the switches.</li>
			<li>There are three classes of <a href="http://svr-pes20-cppmem.cl.cam.ac.uk/cppmem/help.html">relations</a>. From my perspective, the coarser distinction between original and derived relations is the most interesting. Here are the default values.
				<ul>
					<li>Original relations:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>sb</strong>: sequenced-before</li>
							<li><strong>rf:</strong> read from</li>
							<li><strong>mo</strong>: modification order</li>
							<li><strong>sc</strong>: sequentially consistent</li>
							<li><strong>lo</strong>: lock order</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Dervived relations:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>sw:</strong> synchronises-with</li>
							<li><strong>dob</strong>: dependency-ordered-before</li>
							<li><strong>unsequenced_races</strong>: races in a single<span id="transmark"></span> thread</li>
							<li><strong>data_races</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Display Layout</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>You can choose with this switch, which <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygraph/">Doxygraph</a> graph is used.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Model Predicates</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>To be honest, I have no glue, what this switch means. I didn't find anything in the documentation either.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>For a deeper insight you have the official <a href="http://svr-pes20-cppmem.cl.cam.ac.uk/cppmem/help.html">documentation.</a> So, that's enough as staring point. Now it's time to press the run button.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The test run</h2>
<p>The run button shows it immediately. There is a<a href="index.php/threads-sharing-data"> data race</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="images/blog/Speichermodell/CppMemUeberblick/CppMemUeberblickNumbersRun.png" alt="CppMemUeberblickNumbersRun" width="800" height="600" style="margin: 15px;" />&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li>The data race is quite easy to see. A thread writes x (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">x = 3</span>), an other thread unsynchronized reads x (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">x==3</span>). That can not work.</li>
	<li>Two interleavings of threads are possible due to the C++ memory model. Only one of them is consistent. That is the case, if in the expression <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">x==3</span> the value of x is written from the expression&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">int x = 2 </span>in the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">main</span> function. The graph displays this relation in the edge annotated with&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">rf</span> and sw.</li>
	<li>It is extremely interesting to switch between the different interleaving of the threads.</li>
	<li>The graph shows in the format display layout all relations, which you enabled in the Display Relations.
		<ul>
			<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span>:<span style="color: #00ff00;"><span style="color: #339966;">W</span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">na</span> x=2 is in the graphic the&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a</strong></span>-th statement, which is a<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> n</span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">ot</span></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>a</strong><span style="color: #000000;">tomic</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> W</span>rite.</li>
			<li>The key edge in the graph is the edge between the writing of x (b:Wna) and the reading of x (C:Rna). That's the data race on x: (data_race(<span style="color: #ff9900;">dr</span>)).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>That was the test run. I will in the next post analyse the <a href="index.php/relaxed-semantic">simple program</a> with the help of CppMem. You know, this program has undefined behaviour.</p>
