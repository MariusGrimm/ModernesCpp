<p>The key idea of a <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::atomic_thread_fence</span> is, to establish synchronization and ordering constraints between threads without an atomic operation.</p>
<hr id="system-readmore" />
<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::atomic_thread_fence</span> are simply called fences or memory barriers. So you get immediately the idea, what a<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"> std::atomic_thread_fence</span> is all about.</p>
<p>A <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::atomic_thread_fence</span> prevents, that specific operations can overcome a memory barrier.</p>
<h2>Memory barriers</h2>
<p>But what does that mean? Specific operations, which can not overcome a memory barrier. What kind of operations? From a bird's perspective, we have two kinds of operations: Read and write or load and store. So the expression <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">if(resultRead) return result</span> is a load, followed by a store operation.</p>
<p>There are four different ways to combine load and store operations:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>LoadLoad</strong>: A load followed by a load.<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"> <br /></span></li>
	<li><strong>LoadStore:</strong> A load followed by a store.</li>
	<li><strong>StoreLoad:</strong> A store followed by a load.</li>
	<li><strong>StoreStore:</strong> A store followed by a store.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there a complexer operations, consisting of a load and store part <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">(count++). </span>But these operations didn't contradict my general classification.</p>
<p>But what's about memory barriers?. In case you place memory barriers between two operations like LoadLoad, LoadStore, StoreLoad or StoreStore, you have the guarantee, that specific LoadLoad, LoadStore, StoreLoad or StoreStore operations can not be reordered. The risk of reordering is always given, if non atomics or atomics with relaxed semantic are used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, three kinds of memory barriers are used. They are called <strong>full fence, acquire fence</strong> and <strong>release fence.</strong> Only in order to remind you. Acquire is a load, release is a store operation. So, what's happening, if I place one of the three memory barriers between the four combinations of load and store operations?</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Full fence: </strong>A full fence <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::atomic_thread_fence()</span> between two arbitrary operations prevents the reordering of these operations.</li>
	<li><strong>Acquire fence: </strong>An acquire fence <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std:.atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire</span>) prevents, that a read operation before an acquire fence can be reordered with a read or write operation after the acquire fence.<em></em></li>
	<li><strong>Release fence: </strong>A <em>release fence</em> <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::memory_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release)</span> prevents, that a read or write operation before a release fence can be reordered with a write operation after a release fence.<em></em></li>
</ul>
<p>I admit, that I invested&nbsp;a lot of energy to get the definitions of an acquire and release fence and there consequences for lock-free programming. Especially the subtle difference to the acquire-release semantic of atomic operations are not so easy to get. But, before I come to that point, I will illustrate the definitions with graphics.</p>
<h3>Memory barriers illustrated</h3>
<p>Which kind of operations can overcome a memory barrier? Have a look at the three following graphics. If the arrow is crossed with a red bar, the fence prevents this kind of operation.</p>
<h4>Full fence</h4>

<p>Of course, you can explicitly write instead of<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"> std::atomic_thread_fence()</span> <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)</span>. Per default, <a href="index.php/sequential-consistency"> sequential consistency </a>is used for fences.</p>
<h4>Acquire fence</h4>
<p><img src="images/blog/Speichermodell/ZaeunceAlsSpeicherbarrieren/AcquireFence.png" alt="AcquireFence" width="600" height="177" style="margin: 15px;" /></p>
<h4>Release fence</h4>
<p><img src="images/blog/Speichermodell/ZaeunceAlsSpeicherbarrieren/ReleaseFence.png" alt="ReleaseFence" width="600" height="174" style="margin: 15px;" /></p>
<p>But I can depict the three memory barriers even more concise.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>That was the theory. The practice will follow in the next post. In this post, I compare in the first step an acquire fence with an acquire operation, a release fence with a release operation. In the second step, I port a&nbsp;<span id="transmark"></span>producer consumer scenario with acquire release operations to fences.&nbsp;</p>
