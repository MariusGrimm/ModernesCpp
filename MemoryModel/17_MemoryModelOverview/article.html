<p>Since C++11, C++ has a memory model. It is the foundation for multithreading, multithreading was undefined without a memory model.&nbsp;</p>
<hr id="system-readmore" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The C++ memory model consists of two aspects. On the one hand there is the enormous complexity of the memory model, which often contradicts our intuition. On the other hand the memory model helps a lot to get a deeper insight in the mulitithreading challenges.</p>
<h2>The contract</h2>
<p>In the first approach the C++ memory model defines a contract. This contract is signed between the programmer and the system. The system consists of the compiler, which compiles the program into assembler instructions, the processor, which performs the assembler instructions and the different caches &nbsp;storing the program state. The contract requires from the programmer&nbsp;to obey certain rules, and gives the system the full power to optimize the program as far as no rules are broken. The result is - in the good case - a well defined program with a highest level of optimization Precisely speaking, there is not a single contract, but a fine-grained set of contracts. Or to say it differently, the weaker the rules are the programmer has to follow, the more potential is there for the system to generate a highly optimized executable.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb is quite easy. The stronger the contract, the fewer liberties for the system to generate an optimized executable. Sadly, the other way around will not work. In case the programmer uses an extremely weak contract or memory model, there are a lot of optimization choices. But the program is only manageable by a few worldwide known experts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contracts in C++11 have there levels.</p>

<p>Before C++11 there was only one contract. C++ was not aware of the existence of mulithreading or atomics. The system only knows about one control flow and therefore there were only restricted opportunities to optimize the executable. The key point of the system was &nbsp;to keep the illusion for the programmer that the observed behaviour of the program corresponds to the sequence of the instructions in the source code. Of course, there was no memory model. Instead there was the concept of a sequence point. Sequence points are points in the program in which the effects of all instructions before must be observable. Function's start and end points of execution are sequence points. But if you invoke a function with two arguments, the C++ standard makes no guarantee which arguments will be evaluated &nbsp;first. So the behaviour is undefined. The reason is straight forward. The comma operator is no sequence point. That will not change in C++11.</p>
<p>But with C++ all will change. C++11 is the first time aware of multiple threads. The reason for the well defined behaviour of threads is the C++ memory model. The C++ memory model is inspired by the Java memory model, but the C++ one goes&nbsp; - as ever - a few steps further (it will be a topic for the next posts). So the programmer has to obey a few rules while dealing with shared variables to get a well defined program. The program is undefined if there exists at least one data race. As I already mentioned, you have to be aware of data races if your threads share mutable data. So tasks are a lot easier to use than threads or condition variables.</p>
<p>With atomics,&nbsp;we enter the domain of the experts. This will become more evident, the further we weaken the C++ memory model. Often we speak about lock-free programming, when we use atomics. I spoke in the posts about the weak and strong rules. Indeed, the sequential consistency is called strong memory model, the relaxed semantic weak memory model.</p>
<h2>The meaning of the contract</h2>
<p>The contract between the programmer and the system consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atomic operations</strong>: Operations, which will be executed without interruption.</li>
<li><strong>Partial order of operations</strong>: Sequence of operations, which can not be changed.</li>
<li><strong>Visible effects of operations</strong>: Guarantees, when an operation on shared variables will be visible in another thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>The foundation of the contract are operations on atomics. These operations have two characteristics. They are atomic and they create synchronization and order constraints on the program execution. These synchronizations and order constraints will often also hold for non atomic operations. On one hand<span id="transmark"></span> an atomic operation is always atomic, but on the other hand, you can tailor the synchronizations and order constraints to your needs.</p>
<h2>Back to the big picture</h2>
<p>The more we weaken the memory model, the more our focus will change.</p>
<ul>
<li>More optimization potential for the system</li>
<li>Number of control flows of the program increases exponentential</li>
<li>Domain for the experts</li>
<li>Break of the intuition</li>
<li>Area for micro optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>To make multithreading, we must be an experts. In case we want to deal with atomics (sequential consistency), we should open the door to the next expertise level. And you know what will happen when we talk about the acquire-release or relaxed semantic? We'll go each time one step higher to the next expertise level.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In the next posts I dive deeper into the C++ memory model. So, the next posts will be about lock-free programming. On my journey, I will talk about atomics and their operations. In case we are done with the basics, the different levels of the memory model will follow. The starting point will be the straight forward sequential consistency, the acquire-release semantic will follow and the not so intuitive relaxed semantic will be the end point. The next post is about the default behaviour of atomic operations: Sequential consistency.</p>
