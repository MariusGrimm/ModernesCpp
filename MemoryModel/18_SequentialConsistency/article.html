<p>The atomics are the base of the C++ memory model. Per default sequential consistency is applied.</p>

<h2>The strong C++ memory model<span id="transmark"></span></h2>
<p>In 2004 Java 5.0 got its current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_memory_model">memory model</a>, so has done C++ in in 2011.&nbsp; Before that, Java had an erroneous memory model and C++ had no memory model whatsoever. Someone who thinks that this is the endpoint of a long process, is totally mistaken. The foundations of multithreading programming are 40 to 50 years old. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie Lamport </a>defined the concept of sequential consistency in&nbsp;1979.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential consistency</strong>&nbsp;provides two guarantees.</p>
<ol>
<li>The instructions of a program are executed in source code order.</li>
<li>There is a global order of all operations on all threads.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I look deeper in these two guarantees, I explicitly emphasise: the statements only holds for <em>atomics</em> but influences <em>non atomics</em>.</p>
<p>The simple graphic displays two threads. Each thread is storing its variable <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">x</span> or <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">y</span>, loads the other variable <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">y</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">x</span> and stores them in the variable <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">res1</span> or <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">res2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The operations take place on atomics and so, they are atomic. By default&nbsp;sequential consistency applies. But the question is - &nbsp;in which order can the statements take place?</p>
<p>First guarantee&nbsp;&nbsp;of the sequential consistency is that the instruction will be executed in the order of the source code. That is easy. No store-operation can overtake a load-operation.</p>
<p>Second guarantee of the sequential consistency guarantees is that all instructions of all threads have to follow a global order. That means in that concrete case, that thread 2 sees the operations of thread 1 in the same order, in which thread 1 executes them. This is the key point. <strong>Thread 2 sees all operations of thread 1 in the source code order of thread 1.</strong> The same holds from the perspective of thread 1. So you can think about characteristic 2 as a global counter, which all threads have to obey. The global counter is the global order.</p>
<p>We're not done with our riddle right now. What is still missing, is to look at the different interleaving executions of the two threads. So the following six interleavings of two threads are possible:</p>

<p>That was easy. Or?</p>
<h2>From the strong to the weak memory model</h2>
<p>I want to refer once more&nbsp;to the <a href="index.php/c-memory-model">picture</a> of the contract between the programmer and the system.</p>
<p>The programmer is using atomics in this concrete example. He obeys his part of the contract by using them in the right way. The system guarantees him a well defined program behaviour without data races. In addition, the system can execute these four operations in each combination. In case the programmer uses the relaxed semantic, the contract dramatically changes. On one hand it is a lot more difficult for the programmer to apply the contract in the right way. On the other hand the system has a lot more optimization possibilities. With the relaxed semantic - also called weak memory model - there are a lot more possible&nbsp;combinations of the four operations. The counter-intuitive behaviour is, that the thread 1 can see the operations of thread 2 in a different order. So there is no picture of a global counter. From the perspective of thread 1 it is possible, that the operation <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">res= y.load()</span> overtakes&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier new,
courier;">x.store().</span></p>
<p>Between the sequential consistency and the relaxed-semantic there a few more models. The most important one is the acquire-release semantic. I think you already guess it. With acquire-release semantic the programmer has to obey stronger rules than with sequential consistency. But the system has more optimization possibilities. The acquire-release semantic is the key to a deeper understanding of the multithreading programming, because the threads will be synchronized at a specific synchronization points in the code. Without these synchronization points there is no well defined behaviour of threads, tasks or condition variables possible. More about that in following post. &nbsp; <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;"></span></span></p>
