There are ten rules for overloading and overload operators in the C++ core guidelines. Lots of them are quite obvious but if you don't follow them, your software may become very unintuitive.

I'm quite surprised having only ten rules for overloading in the guidelines. I'm in particular surprised because I had a lot of discussions in the past about overloading of operators in C++. Additionally, MISRA C++ which is heavily usind in the automotive and embedded area at least forbids operators overloading.

In contrast to the discussion in C++, I have not a discussion in Python about operator overloading in mind, but Python is heavily based on operator overloading. To get an idea. Hava a look at all the following special functions starting and ending with two underscores; lovingly called dunder in Python. You have to implement them to get a type that behaves such as an int.

 But let me continue with C++. Here are the ten rules.

    C.160: Define operators primarily to mimic conventional usage
    C.161: Use nonmember functions for symmetric operators
    C.162: Overload operations that are roughly equivalent
    C.163: Overload only for operations that are roughly equivalent
    C.164: Avoid conversion operators
    C.165: Use using for customization points
    C.166: Overload unary & only as part of a system of smart pointers and references
    C.167: Use an operator for an operation with its conventional meaning
    C.168: Define overloaded operators in the namespace of their operands
    C.170: If you feel like overloading a lambda, use a generic lambda

A lot of the rules are quite obvious; therefore, I often can make it short.
Overloading and overloaded operators
C.160: Define operators primarily to mimic conventional usage

You should follow the principle of least astonishment. Or to say it in the words of the rule C: 61: A copy operation should copy. That means after the assignment x = y, x == y should hold.

This was obvious. Right? The next rule sounds easy but the discussion of it is quite enlighting.
C.161: Use nonmember functions for symmetric operators

In general, the implementation of a symmetric operator such as + is inside the class not possible.

Assume that you want to implement a type MyInt. MyInt should support addition with MyInt's and built-in int's. Let's give it a try.

// MyInt.cpp

struct MyInt{
    MyInt(int v):val(v){};              // 1
    MyInt operator+(const MyInt& oth) const { 
        return MyInt(val + oth.val);
    }
    int val;
};

int main(){

  MyInt myFive = MyInt(2) + MyInt(3);
  MyInt myFive2 = MyInt(3) + MyInt(2);
  
  MyInt myTen = myFive + 5;            // 2
  MyInt myTen2 = 5 + myFive;           // 3 ERROR
  
}
  

 

Because of the implicit conversion constructor (1), the expression (2) is valid. In contrast, the last expression (3) is not valid, because the 5 in the expression 5 + myFive will not implicitly convert to a MyInt; therefore, I got a compiler error.

Trying to compile the program will fail because int does not have an overloaded + operator for MyInt. 

MyIntError

The small program has a lot of issues:

    The + operator is not symmetric.
    The val variable is public.
    The conversion constructor is implicit.

It's quite easy to overcome the first both issues with a non-member operator + that is in the class declared as friend.

  

// MyInt2.cpp

class MyInt2{
public:
    MyInt2(int v):val(v){};
    friend MyInt2 operator+(const MyInt2& fir, const MyInt2& sec){ 
        return MyInt2(fir.val + sec.val);
    }
private:
    int val;
};

int main(){

  MyInt2 myFive = MyInt2(2) + MyInt2(3);
  MyInt2 myFive2 = MyInt2(3) + MyInt2(2);
  
  MyInt2 myTen = myFive + 5;
  MyInt2 myTen2 = 5 + myFive;           
  
}
  

 

Now, implicit conversion from int to MyInt kicks in and the variable val is private. According to rule C.164: Avoid conversion operators, you should not use an implicit conversion constructor. By making the conversion constructor in the following example explicit, the example will break.

// MyInt3.cpp

class MyInt3{
public:
    explicit MyInt3(int v):val(v){};           // 1
    friend MyInt3 operator+(const MyInt3& fir, const MyInt3& sec){ 
        return MyInt3(fir.val + sec.val);
    }
private:
    int val;
};

int main(){

  MyInt3 myFive = MyInt3(2) + MyInt3(3);
  MyInt3 myFive2 = MyInt3(3) + MyInt3(2);
  
  MyInt3 myTen = myFive + 5;                   // 2
  MyInt3 myTen2 = 5 + myFive;                  // 3
  
}

 

Thanks to the explicit conversion operator, implicit conversion from int to MyInt will not happen and, therefore, the lines (2) and (3) fail.

MyInt3Error

At least I followed the rule and my operator is symmetric.

One obvious way to solve the original challenge is, to implement two additional + operators for MyInt4. One should take an int as left and one should take an int as right argument.

// MyInt4.cpp

class MyInt4{
public:
    explicit MyInt4(int v):val(v){};           // 1
    friend MyInt4 operator+(const MyInt4& fir, const MyInt4& sec){ 
        return MyInt4(fir.val + sec.val);
    }
    friend MyInt4 operator+(const MyInt4& fir, int sec){
        return MyInt4(fir.val + sec);
    }
     friend MyInt4 operator+(int fir, const MyInt4& sec){
        return MyInt4(fir + sec.val);
    }
private:
    int val;
};

int main(){

  MyInt4 myFive = MyInt4(2) + MyInt4(3);
  MyInt4 myFive2 = MyInt4(3) + MyInt4(2);
  
  MyInt4 myTen = myFive + 5;                   // 2
  MyInt4 myTen2 = 5 + myFive;                  // 3
  
}

C.162: Overload operations that are roughly equivalent and C.163: Overload only for operations that are roughly equivalent

This time, I can make it short. Equivalent operations should have same name. Or the other way around. Non-equivalent operations should not have the same name.

Here is a example from the guidelines:

void print(int a);
void print(int a, int base);
void print(const string&);

 

Invoking print(arg) with an argument feels like generic programming. You have not to care which version of print will be used.

This will not hold for the three next functions, because they have different names:

void print_int(int a);
void print_based(int a, int base);
void print_string(const string&);

 

If non-equivalent operations have the same name the names are maybe to general or just wrong. This is confusing and error-prone.
What's next?

The next rule is quite important: C.164: Avoid conversion operators. I already mentioned it in rule C.161. You should not use an implicit conversion constructor and - this is new - an implicit conversion operator. Why? I will write about it in the next post.
